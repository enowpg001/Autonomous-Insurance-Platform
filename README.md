## Smart Contract Modules

### Key Contracts
- `PolicyRegistry.sol`: Policy management
- `RiskAssessment.sol`: Dynamic risk calculation
- `ClaimProcessor.sol`: Claim verification
- `StakingPool.sol`: Community liquidity management
- `PremiumOracle.sol`: External data integration

### Risk Scoring Model
```javascript
struct RiskProfile {
  baseRisk: uint256;
  dynamicFactors: {
    healthHistory: uint8;
    geographicLocation: uint8;
    assetCondition: uint8;
    claimHistory: uint8;
  }
  finalRiskScore: uint256;
}
```
